#Guitar Battle

- Our first game app built by Enrique Colomer and Silviu Dilimot under the supervision of Teodoro Lopez y German Alvarez as a final project for the first module of IronHack WebDev Bootcamp

##Lessons Learned

- DOM manipulation
- OOP (classes, subclasses, inheritance)
- asynk functions
- use of specific Array methods
- canvas API
- Creation of HTML Audio Elements using the Audio() constructor

##Overcomed Challenges

- positioning images in HTML
- emptying an array from an object's key-value pair  ("deep-deleting"). Example: when an enemy ship is destroyed, the shots keep roaming

##Inovations

- randomized tracking algorithm for EnemyShip, using a probability conditioned movement

##Bugs

- does not scale well when deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://silviudn.github.io/GuitarBattle/)

##Potential Future Features

- two human players version
- 2D sprites for players
- sound turn on/off option
